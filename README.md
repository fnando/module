# Module.js

Define namespaces as constructor functions (or any object).

## Usage

Create a new module.

```javascript
Module("Todo.Application", function(Application){
  Application.fn.initialize = function() {
    // execute something when initializing the object.
  };
});

var app = new Todo.Application();
    app = Todo.Application(); // the new keyword is optional.
```

Define namespace with custom objects.

```javascript
Module("Todo.config", function(config){
  config.assets = "/assets";
}, {});
```

Define namespace without a callback.

```javascript
Module("Todo.config", {});
```
